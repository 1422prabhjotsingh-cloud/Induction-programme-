# Day-1
## Date- 30/7/2025
### The first day of the induction program began with a visit to the Gurudwara Sahib, a serene and spiritual start to our college journey. The Gurudwara’s architecture was uniquely designed in the shape of a boat, symbolizing guidance and safe passage through the voyage of life. After the prayer service, we were served light snacks, providing a moment to interact with fellow students. This informal setting gave me the opportunity to make a few new friends, helping me feel more comfortable and connected from the very first day.

### At 10:00 AM, we assembled for the Inaugural Ceremony, where we were formally introduced to various faculty members and administrative staff. This session offered us an overview of the college environment, its values, and the key individuals who would be guiding us in the coming years
# Day-2
## Date-1/8/2025
### The second day commenced with an insightful lecture by Ms. Priya Darshni on Universal Human Values. Her session emphasized the importance of empathy, integrity, and mutual respect in shaping both personal character and professional conduct. This was followed by a lecture by Mr. Arvind Dhingra, which, although I do not recall in detail, contributed to the variety of perspectives we were exposed to during the program.

### After a short break, we undertook our first proficiency tests in English and Mathematics. The English section felt manageable and straightforward, allowing me to answer with confidence. Mathematics, however, was a bit more challenging, but I am optimistically expecting a score of around 22 out of 30.
# Day-3
## Date- 4/08/2025
### Day 3 began a little earlier than usual, starting at 8:30 AM. The first session was conducted by the Causmic Club, a student-led organization that plans and manages various events on campus. It was inspiring to see how active and creative the student community is in organizing activities that bring everyone together.

### Following this, Dr. Ranhir Singh delivered an informative lecture on the Conduct of Examinations, providing us with clear guidelines and an understanding of the procedures to be followed during assessments. Next, Ms. Priya Darshni presented another session on Human Values, further deepening our understanding of ethics, empathy, and moral responsibility.

### After a short break, we attended a Physics lecture by Ms. Amarjot Kaur, which was highly engaging and enriching. The day concluded with a peer-to-peer session on C++ programming, introducing us to fundamental concepts and enhancing our technical knowledge.
# Day-4
## Date-5/08/2025
### Day 4 was noticeably shorter than the previous ones, with college starting at 1:30 PM — a rare treat for anyone who values their sleep. The first session was led by Mr. Gautam Murria on the fascinating world of Motor Sports. The energy and passion he brought to the topic made it easy to imagine ourselves on the race track… or at least in the driver’s seat of a very fast laptop.

### Next, we had a session with Dr. Amit Kamre, the in-charge of the Digital Marketing Club. He introduced us to the club’s activities and shared how digital marketing is shaping modern industries. It was interesting to see how creativity and analytics go hand in hand in this field.

### The day concluded with Mrs. Shaffy delivering an insightful lecture on Millets as a Superfood. By the end of it, I had learned not only about the health benefits of millets but also that they might just be the most underrated heroes of our kitchen shelves. The program wrapped up at 4:00 PM, giving us an unusually early finish — and a little extra time to “study”… or so we tell ourselves.
