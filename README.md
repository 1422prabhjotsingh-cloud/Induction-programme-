# INTRODUCTION
### The induction program at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, held from 30 July to 9 August 2025, marked the official beginning of my journey as a university student. Over the course of seven active days (excluding weekends and holidays), we were introduced to the institution’s values, resources, clubs, and academic culture. The program featured a mix of lectures, workshops, peer-to-peer sessions, and motivational talks, giving us a holistic understanding of college life. Beyond academics, it also provided the perfect setting to make new friends, interact with seniors, and feel truly welcomed into the GNDEC family.

# Day-1
## Date- 30/7/2025
### The first day of the induction program began with a visit to the Gurudwara Sahib, a serene and spiritual start to our college journey. The Gurudwara’s architecture was uniquely designed in the shape of a boat, symbolizing guidance and safe passage through the voyage of life. After the prayer service, we were served light snacks, providing a moment to interact with fellow students. This informal setting gave me the opportunity to make a few new friends, helping me feel more comfortable and connected from the very first day.

### At 10:00 AM, we assembled for the Inaugural Ceremony, where we were formally introduced to various faculty members and administrative staff. This session offered us an overview of the college environment, its values, and the key individuals who would be guiding us in the coming years
# Day-2

### The second day commenced with an insightful lecture by Ms. Priya Darshni on Universal Human Values. Her session emphasized the importance of empathy, integrity, and mutual respect in shaping both personal character and professional conduct. This was followed by a lecture by Mr. Arvind Dhingra, which, although I do not recall in detail, contributed to the variety of perspectives we were exposed to during the program.

### After a short break, we undertook our first proficiency tests in English and Mathematics. The English section felt manageable and straightforward, allowing me to answer with confidence. Mathematics, however, was a bit more challenging, but I am optimistically expecting a score of around 22 out of 30.

### Day 3 began a little earlier than usual, starting at 8:30 AM. The first session was conducted by the Causmic Club, a student-led organization that plans and manages various events on campus. It was inspiring to see how active and creative the student community is in organizing activities that bring everyone together.

### Following this, Dr. Ranhir Singh delivered an informative lecture on the Conduct of Examinations, providing us with clear guidelines and an understanding of the procedures to be followed during assessments. Next, Ms. Priya Darshni presented another session on Human Values, further deepening our understanding of ethics, empathy, and moral responsibility.

### After a short break, we attended a Physics lecture by Ms. Amarjot Kaur, which was highly engaging and enriching. The day concluded with a peer-to-peer session on C++ programming, introducing us to fundamental concepts and enhancing our technical knowledge.
# Day-4
## Date-5/08/2025
### Day 4 was noticeably shorter than the previous ones, with college starting at 1:30 PM — a rare treat for anyone who values their sleep. The first session was led by Mr. Gautam Murria on the fascinating world of Motor Sports. The energy and passion he brought to the topic made it easy to imagine ourselves on the race track… or at least in the driver’s seat of a very fast laptop.

### Next, we had a session with Dr. Amit Kamre, the in-charge of the Digital Marketing Club. He introduced us to the club’s activities and shared how digital marketing is shaping modern industries. It was interesting to see how creativity and analytics go hand in hand in this field.

### The day concluded with Mrs. Shaffy delivering an insightful lecture on Millets as a Superfood. By the end of it, I had learned not only about the health benefits of millets but also that they might just be the most underrated heroes of our kitchen shelves. The program wrapped up at 4:00 PM, giving us an unusually early finish — and a little extra time to “study”… or so we tell ourselves.
# Day-5
## Date-6/08/2025
### Day 5 kicked off at 9:30 AM with Dr. Parminder Singh, Dean of Student Welfare, giving us an insightful overview of our university, GNDEC. His session helped us understand the institution’s vision, opportunities, and resources — essentially the “map” for navigating our years ahead.

### The next session by Mr. Manpreet Singh on Fitness for Engineers was nothing short of electrifying. The energy in the auditorium was at another level, and his inspiring personal background left a lasting impression on me. Without a doubt, it was the best lecture I have attended so far, blending motivation, life lessons, and practical advice seamlessly.

### Following this, Army Brigadier P.S. Cheema spoke about the National Cadet Corps (NCC), highlighting the discipline, leadership, and patriotism it instills in students.

### After a short break, we wrapped up the day with a lecture on English, followed by a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) session. By the end of the day, I felt both inspired and slightly overwhelmed — a combination that seems to be the official theme of this induction program.

### The day began at 9:30 AM with a Mathematics lecture by Prof. Sukhwinder Singh, where we explored key concepts with clarity and precision — a refreshing reminder that numbers, when explained well, can actually make sense. This was followed by a Physics session on Lasers, a topic that felt equal parts futuristic and fascinating.

### After the break, Dr. Lakhvir Singh Khanna, In-charge of the CML, introduced us to the center’s initiatives and opportunities for skill development. The day concluded with Dr. Jasvir Singh Grewal, In-charge of the National Service Scheme (NSS), who encouraged us to actively participate in various camps and community service activities.
