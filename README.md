# üè´ My GNDEC Induction Program experience
## *30 July- 9 August 2025*
# INTRODUCTION
### The induction program at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, held from 30 July to 9 August 2025, marked the official start of my journey as a university student. During seven active days, excluding weekends and holidays, we learned about the institution‚Äôs values, resources, clubs, and academic culture. The program included lectures, workshops, peer sessions, and motivational talks, giving us a well-rounded view of college life. Beyond academics, it also provided a great chance to make new friends, connect with seniors, and feel truly welcomed into the GNDEC family.

# Day-1
## Date- 30/7/2025 (üõï Gurudwara Visit & Inaugural Ceremony )
### The first day of the induction program started with a visit to the Gurudwara Sahib. This was a peaceful and spiritual beginning to our college experience. The Gurudwara‚Äôs design resembled a boat, symbolizing guidance through life‚Äôs journey. After the prayer service, we enjoyed light snacks, allowing us to interact with fellow students. This relaxed setting helped me make a few new friends, making me feel more comfortable from day one.  

### At 10:00 AM, we gathered for the Inaugural Ceremony. Here, we met various faculty members and administrative staff. This session gave us an overview of the college environment, its values, and the key people who would guide us in the coming years.
